We have added the Gemini Tools to Galaxy Australia. These tools are for doing integrative exploration of genetic variation and genome annotations. The documentation for these tools can be found [here](https://gemini.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). You can find these tools under the **Gemini Tools** section of the Galaxy Australia tool menu.
