**Galaxy Australia has been upgraded to the latest Galaxy release. Version 19.05.**
<br/>
This morning after a brief planned outage, Galaxy Australia was upgraded to the latest version of Galaxy. You will notice some changes straight away - The colour scheme is different and the look and feel has altered. Everything else is the same however!

This release includes:

* Tool favourites! You can now tag tools that you use all the time and create your own "mini tool list"
* Improvements to History import/export.
* A data selection dialog within tool forms to make it easier to select the data the tool is to run on.

Please see the [user release notes](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/release_19.05/releases/19.05_announce_user.html) for additional information.
