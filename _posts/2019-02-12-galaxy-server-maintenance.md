Galaxy Australia will be undergoing maintenance for 2 hours on the 20th February 2019 from 10:00am AEDT. It will be getting:
* a new landing page
* the tool panel will be updated to match usegalaxy.org and usegalaxy.eu
* the backend will be upgraded to fix some job running issues

We thank you for your patience in advance.
