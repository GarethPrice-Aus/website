**Galaxy Australia has been upgraded to the latest Galaxy release. Version 19.01.**
<br/>
This morning after a brief planned outage, Galaxy Australia was upgraded to the latest version of Galaxy. You will notice some changes straight away - The colour scheme is different and the look and feel has altered. Everything else is the same however!

This release includes the revised UI style, addition of colourful tags, extensive workflow enhancements, and enhanced support for Singularity.

Please see the [release notes](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/release_19.01/releases/19.01_announce.html) for additional information.
