**Galaxy Australia moves to the new QRIS cloud stage 5 hardware**
<br/>
This morning after a planned outage, the Galaxy Australia main queue was moved from it's original home on QRIS cloud to their shiny new hardware! The stage 5 hardware is faster, better connected and much more flexible. This will help Galaxy Australia be more responsive to it's users as we are now able to launch bigger jobs and have them run faster.

For more information about Galaxy Australia's home, see the [QRIScloud website](https://qriscloud.org.au) and the [ARDC](https://ardc.org.au) refresh of the [ NeCTAR Australian Research Cloud](https://ardc.edu.au/collaborations/strategic-activities/storage-and-compute/research-cloud-request-for-proposals/)
