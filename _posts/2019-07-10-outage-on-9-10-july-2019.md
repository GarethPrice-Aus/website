**Galaxy Australia was down due to a backend issue with storage**

10/07/2019 update - We apologise for the interruption yesterday and earlier today. Our storage provider had an issue with their system effecting Galaxy Australia's and other clients access. Once it was corrected, Galaxy Australia came back up very quickly.
