You may have noticed that Galaxy Australia was slow to respond from the 20th - 22nd of March 2019 - This has been resolved. Upon investigation the slow down was caused by a live migration of some of the backend storage to a new faster platform. The migration is mostly completed and our normal excellent level of service was resumed on the 23rd March.

We thank you for your patience during this time.

Galaxy Australia Admin Team.
